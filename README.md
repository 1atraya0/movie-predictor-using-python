🎬 Movie Predictor using LSTM

This project uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to predict movie success based on historical data such as box office collections, audience reviews, and other relevant features.

📌 Features

Predicts movie success based on past trends

Uses LSTM for time-series forecasting

Processes box office revenue, reviews, ratings, and other factors

Implements TensorFlow/Keras for deep learning

Supports visualization of predictions


🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

TensorFlow / Keras (Deep Learning)

NumPy & Pandas (Data Handling)

Matplotlib & Seaborn (Visualization)

Scikit-learn (Preprocessing)

📊 Dataset

The dataset should contain historical movie data, including:

Box office revenue

Audience & critic reviews

Genre, budget, runtime, etc.

Release date trends



🎯 Model Training

To train the LSTM model, run:

python src/train.py

The model will be saved in the models/ folder.

🔮 Making Predictions

To predict a new movie’s success, use:

python src/predict.py --movie "Movie Name"

📈 Results & Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using RMSE and accuracy metrics.

Results are visualized using graphs.


📌 Future Improvements

Improve accuracy with more features

Use transformers for better sequence modeling

Deploy as a web app using Flask or FastAPI
